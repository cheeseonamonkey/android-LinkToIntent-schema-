uri scheme links to android intents

## huh?

the idea was to register a uri schema in the manifest, then parse the uri information to an intent

This is *sort of* already a thing, but it doesn't work in 'web browser' categorized intents - *i.e. Chrome; or a a link in an electrum application (Obsidian.MD)*
